# html_css_minor_project
In this exercise I used HTML and CSS to create a single page for a fictional bike company, called Bikcraft.
My main goal was to practice concepts of HTML, such as semantic tags for accessibility and CSS concepts, such as Grid, Flexbox, Align and Justify, Media Queries, etc.
Even tought it's a minor project, it allowed me to practice and develop importat skill to front-end developers.
